        <h1>Hi, I'm Sannaan</h1>

        <p>
            My research centers on explainability and robustness in deep learning, with a focus on computer vision for healthcare and climate.
            I am currently interested in how training methodologies influence interpretability in image analysis.
            Beyond core research, I aim to develop practical, transparent AI systems that can be reliably deployed in high-stakes, real-world environments.
