        <h1>Hi, I'm Sannaan</h1>

        <p>
            My research explores machine learning theory, computer vision, and interpretability, 
            with a focused interest in causal representation learning and the interplay between vision, language, sound, and thought.
            I am driven by curiosity about how these modalities connect and inform each other, 
            and by the potential to apply this understanding to high-risk domains like healthcare. 
            Alongside this, Iâ€™m deeply committed to AI safety and alignment, 
            striving to contribute to the development of responsible and trustworthy AI systems.
